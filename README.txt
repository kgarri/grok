Grok, like its namesake, is meant to be a simple and intuitive programing language
that even the newest programmer should be able to pick up fairly quickly. This allows
programmers to spend more time programming and less time looking up syntax or 
trying to remember the quirks of a specific language. 
This project is a CSC-333 (Programming Language Theory) assignment.
