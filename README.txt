Grok like its namesake is meant to be a simple and intuitive  programing language
that even the newest programmer should be able to pick up fairly quickly. Allowing
for programmers to spend more time programming and less time looking up syntax or 
trying to remeber the quirks of a specific language. 
This project is specifically being made for a CSC-333 class assignment.
